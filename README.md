# Abaza transliteration
This is a TECkit map for the Bulk editor in SIL FieldWorks. It can also be used in SIL Converters. It uses the Abaza alphabet (e. g. see [Omniglot](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/abaza.htm)), with several restrictions and additions:

*  <1>, \<I\> (U+0049, Latin Capital letter I) or <ӏ> (U+04CF, [ Cyrillic small letter Palochka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palochka)) can be used instead of <Ӏ> (U+04C0, [Cyrillic letter Palochka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palochka)).
* The cyrillic <у> by default is ambiguous. We decided to use <у> to denote a sequence [əw]. Remmember that it could be wrong and sometimes <у> denotes just a labial approximant [w].
* I decided to use cyrillic <о> to denote a sequence [aw].
* I decided to use cyrillic <е> to denote a sequence [aj].
* The cyrillic <и> by default is ambiguous. The transliterater transform <и> to [əj].
* Stressed vowels are marked with upper case letters.
